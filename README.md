You need to download the single_chain version of the [CryptoBench dataset](https://osf.io/pz4a9/) and save it to the root directory as `cryptobench`.

### code snippets
To synchronize two directories (local source, remote destination), use similar snippet:
```
rsync -a apo-voxel-features/ skrhakv@gpulab.ms.mff.cuni.cz:/home/skrhakv/deeplife/deeplife-project/data/apo-voxel-features/
```
